# Central Processing Unit
#COMP1211 
## Control Unit (CU)
- an instruction interpreter
- It takes instructions from [Memory](COMP1211-ComputerArchitecture/Memory.md) and then decodes and executes these instructions
- mainly regulates and maintains the information's flow across the processor
- It does not take part in storing data and processing.
## Arithmetic and logic unit (ALU)
-Â performs arithmetic and logical functions
- The arithmetic functions are addition, subtraction, multiplication division, and comparisons
- logical functions mainly include selecting, comparing, and merging the data
- There can be more than one ALU in a CPU
- ALUs can be used for maintaining timers that help run the computer
## Cache
- Quick [[Memory|RAM]] for copying and receiving instructions
- It uses [[../Registers]] to store data being used in current instruction units
