## Valves
![[Images/Pasted image 20230201103054.png]]
- invented 1904 by John Fleming
- electrons released by thermionic emission of heated plate
- electrons move towards anode with more positive potential
- rather large, made of glass

## Transistor
- successor to valves
- composed of semiconductor material
- Two types of semiconductor material are used P-type and N-type
- The arrangement of P-type and N-type semiconductors produce different electronic properties
### Anatomy
![[Images/Pasted image 20230201104208.png]]
- P-type semiconductor have electron “holes”
- N-type semiconductor have added electrons(doped semiconductor)
- Transistors are produced by stacking semiconductors in either a NPN or PNP arrangement
### Functionality
- Electrons can travel from N-type semiconductor to P-type semiconductor (with a little external force)
- Electrons can easily flow from the P-type base to the N-type collector as long as the base-emitter junction is forward biased (base is at a higher voltage than the emitter).
- The NPN transistor is designed to pass electrons from the emitter to the collector, subject to the current present at the base.
- **Remember electrons flow from negative to positive,conventional current flows from positive to negative**
#### Saturation
- The transistor acts like a short circuit and currentflows freely from the collector to the emitter
- For a transistor to be saturated VE < VB and VC < VB
- As a result of the construction of a transistor the voltage at the base must be at about 0.6v to saturate the transistor (0.6v is approximately the voltage drop across a diode)
#### Cutoff
- The transistor is off
- The transistor acts like an open circuit and no current flows from the collector to the emitter
- For a transistor to be “cutoff” VC > VB and VE > VB
- To achieve cut off the voltage across the base andemitter should be between 0v and 0.6v
