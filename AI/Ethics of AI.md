## Motivations

- Capability to design and maintain complex infrastructure

- Caring for ill or frail people
- New kinds of entertainment
- Aiding creative work such as making art, music or films
- Enhancing humansâ€™ physical and/or mental capabilities
## Possible Negative Affects of AI
We should also be aware that adverse affects are also possible:
- Causing unemployment
- Making life complex and stressful
- Draining resources
- Introducing unfair bias into decision making
- Manipulating human lives
- Detaching humans from reality
- Competing with, threatening or destroying humans
## Levels of AI
- Weak (aka Narrow) AI 
	- Perform specific tasks
	- One of a kind
	- Tasks that would be described as requiring intelligence if done by humans
- Strong (aka General) AI 
	- Achieving a potentially unlimited range of tasks,which are regarded as involving intelligence. 
	- It is generally assumed that humans have this, whereas no current computer system does. 
- Super-intelligence 
	- Intelligence that goes significantly beyond that of any human being. 
	- Some theorists believe that this is possible and could potentially be dangerous for humans
