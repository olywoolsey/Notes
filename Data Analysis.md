# Data Analysis
## Exploratory
Understand the data and figure out what might be noteworthy or interesting to highlight to others.Like hunting for pearls in Oysters.We might have to open 100 oysters (test 100 different hypotheses or look at the data in 100 differentways) to find perhaps 2 pearls
## Explanatory
When we’re at the point of communicating our analysis to our audience, wereally want to be in the explanatory space, meaning you have a specific thingyou want to explain, a specific story you want to tell—probably about those 2pearls
## What to consider before you make a visualisation for presentation
