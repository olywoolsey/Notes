# Data Analysis
## Types
### Exploratory
Understand the data and figure out what might be noteworthy or interesting to highlight to others.Like hunting for pearls in Oysters.We might have to open 100 oysters (test 100 different hypotheses or look at the data in 100 different ways) to find perhaps 2 pearls
### Explanatory
When we’re at the point of communicating our analysis to our audience, we really want to be in the explanatory space, meaning you have a specific thing you want to explain, a specific story you want to tell—probably about those 2 pearls
## What to consider before you make a visualisation for presentation
### Analysis and Context
#### Who?
- Who are you communicating to?
	- Do they already know a lot about the area your are presenting in? 
	- Do you have a lay audience
	- What relationship do you have to the audience?
	- Do you already have a relationship of trust?
	- Bias that the audience may already have?
#### What?
- What do you need your audience to know (level of detail)?
	- What actions do you want your audience to take after the presentation?
	- What is at stake?
	- What are the key points you are trying to convey?
	- What is the story your data is trying to deliver?
#### How?
- How can you use the data to help make these points?
	- How will you present the data?
	- How will you make your message clear and memorable?
### Techniques
#### Key idea (big idea)
One sentence that articulates your point of view and what is at stake.
- It must articulate your unique point of view
- It must convey what’s at stake
- It must be a complete sentence
#### Storyboarding
- Identify your key points
- Consider the sequence of information you want to describe
- Sketch visualisations

## Visulisation
- **Do not use Pie/Doughnutcharts**
- **Don't use 3D**
- **Bar Charts must have zero baseline**
- **Secondary Y-axis – Generally confusing**
	- Try Labeling each node seperately
