## Product Rule
- a sequence of independent steps
- Suppose that a procedure can be broken down into a sequence of two tasks. If there are n<sub>1</sub> ways to do the first task and for each of these ways of doing the first task, there are n<sub>2</sub> ways to do the second task, then there are  $n_1n_2$ ways to do the procedure.

## Sum Rule
If a task can be done either in one of $n_1$ ways or in one of $n_2$ ways, where none of the set of $n_1$ ways is the same as any of the set of $n_2$ ways, then there are $n_1$ + $n_2$ ways to do the task.

## Subtraction Rule
If a task can be done in either n<sub>1</sub> ways or n<sub>2</sub> ways, then the number of ways to do the task is n<sub>1</sub>+ n<sub>2</sub> minus the number of ways to do the task that are common to the two different ways.

$$ |A_1 \cup A_2| = |A_1| + |A_2| - |A_1 \cap A_2|$$
## Division Rule
There are $\frac{n}{d}$ ways to do a task if it can be done using a procedure that can be carried out in n ways, and for every way $w$, exactly $d$ of the $n$ ways correspond to
way $w$.
