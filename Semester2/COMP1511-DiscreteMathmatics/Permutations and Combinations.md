## Permutations
If n is a positive integer and r is an integer with 1 ≤ r ≤ n, then there are

P(n, r) = n(n − 1)(n − 2) ⋯ (n − r + 1)
r-permutations of a set with n distinct elements.

If n and r are integers with 0 ≤ r ≤ n, then P(n, r) = $\frac{n!}{(n − r)!}$

## Combinations
The number of r-combinations of a set with n elements, where n is a non-negative integer and r is an integer with 0 ≤ r ≤ n, equals
$C(n, r) = \frac{n!}{r! (n − r)!}$
