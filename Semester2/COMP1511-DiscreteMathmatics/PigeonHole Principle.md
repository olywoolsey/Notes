If $k$ is a positive integer and $k$ + 1 or more objects are placed into $k$ boxes, then there is at least one box containing two or more of the objects.

Example:
Show that for every integer n there is a multiple of n that has only 0s and 1s in its decimal expansion.

Solution:
Let n be a positive integer. Consider the n + 1 integers 1, 11, 111, ... , 11 ... 1 (where
the last integer in this list is the integer with n + 1 1s in its decimal expansion). Note that there
are n possible remainders when an integer is divided by n. Because there are n + 1 integers in
this list, by the pigeonhole principle there must be two with the same remainder when divided
by n. The larger of these integers less the smaller one is a multiple of n, which has a decimal
expansion consisting entirely of 0s and 1s.

### The Generalised Pigeonhole Principle
If $N$ objects are placed into $k$ boxes, then there is at least one box containing at least $N âˆ• k$ objects.
