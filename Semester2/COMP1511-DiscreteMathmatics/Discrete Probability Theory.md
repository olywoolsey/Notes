- An experiment is a process that yields an outcome. The set S of all possible outcomes of a given experiment is called the sample space. An event A is a set of outcomes, i.e. a subset of the sample space S.
Since an event is a set, we can combine events to form new events using the various set operations:
	- $A \cup B = A or B$
	- $A \cap B = A and B$
	- $\bar{A}$ = compliment of A, occurs if A does not

## Finite Probability Spaces
- Let $S$ be a finite nonempty space, say $S = \{a_1, a_2 ... a_m\}$
- A finite Probability Space is obtained by assigning each point $a_i$ in $S$ a real number called $p_i$
- $p_i$ if for "probability of $i$" and satisfies:
	- each $p_i$ is non-negative i.e. $p_i \geq 0$
	- The sum of $p_i$ is 1 i.e. $p_1, p_2, ... p_m = 1$
The probability of an event A, written P(A), is the sum of the probabilities of the points in A. The singleton set $\{ai\}$ is called an elementary event, and for notational convenience we write $P(a_i)$ for $P(\{a_i\})$

## Equiprobable Spaces
- A finite probability space $S$ where each sample point has the same probability
- If $S$ contains $n$ points then the probability of each point is $\frac{1}{n}$
$THEOREM1$ Let $A$ be an event. Then $P(A) + P(\bar{A}) = 1$
$THEOREM2$ Let $A_1$ and $A_2$ be events. Then $P(A_1 \cup A_2) = P(A_1) + P(A_2) - P(A_1 \cap A_2)$
$COLLARY1$ If $A_1$ and $A_2$ are mutually exclusive events, then $P(A_1 \cup A_2) = P(A_1) + P(A_2)$

## Conditional Probability
$THEROREM3$ Suppose S is an equiprobable space and $A$ and $E$ are events. Then $P(A|E) = \frac{|A \cap E|}{|E|}$

## Independent Events
- Events $A$ and $B$ are independent id one of them does not influence the other
- $B$ is independent if $P(B) = (PB|A)$
- Events $A$ and $B$ are independent if $P(Aâˆ©B) = P(A)P(B)$; otherwise they are dependent.

## Bayes' Theorem
- We can find the conditional probability that an event $F$ occurs given that an event $E$ has occurred, when we know $P(E|F),P(E|\bar{F})$ and $P(F)$
$THEOREM4$ Suppose that $E$ and $F$ are events from a sample space $S$ such that $P(E) > 0$ and $P(F) > 0$. Then $$P(F|E) = \frac{P(E|F)P(F)}{P(E|F)P(F)+P(E|\bar{F})P(\bar{F})}$$
