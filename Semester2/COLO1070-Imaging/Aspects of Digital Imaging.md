Fewer than 1/5th of images are ever printed
## Digitisation of Analogue Photographic Images
- Flatbed scanner for photographic prints
- Film scanner for photgraphic slides and negatives
- Drum scanner for superior resolution and colour definition
- Picture CD and Photo CD
### Flatbed Scanner
- Connected to computer via USB port
- Imports photographic prints via own software or photo editor
- Has own built-in flourescent, halogen, or LED lightsource and a trilinear CCD sensor(RGB), or Compact Image Sensor
- Sensor fitted to screw-thread tracking rod that travels beneath the image
- Image is illuminated and reflected light is detected in a single pass
- Able to minimise gain from photographic print to digital file
- Minimum 24-bit depth required to create photo-realistic image (8-bits per colour channel) _ most are now 48 bits
### Film Scanner
- Good quality 35mm film scanner capable of creating a digital file that will reproduce an 11 x 17 inch hard copy without pixilation
- Many photographers who prefer to use film are able to achieve better resolution images than many digital cameras
- Attached to PC via USB port and propriety software, used for image importation
- designed to work with a trilinear array CCD where array is moved over film surface detecting the level of transmitted light through th film (negative or positive)
- Needs high optical input resolution and high bit depth
- Minimum reqs: 30-bit for negative. 36-bit for positive

## Image File Formats
- Contains either pixles or vectors to display images
- Contains two parts: the header & the data
#### Header 
Contains: 
- image dimensions (horizontal x vertical)
- image data type (colour and greyscale)
- image bit-depth
- any compression techniques
#### Data (EXIF)
- reveals camera type, lens, apeture-shutter used etc
### RAW File
- RAW is a general term for a number of proprietary data files: Canon .CR2, Nikon .NEF, Pentax .PEF, Fuji .RAF and Sigma .X3F 
- Adobe’s DNG (Digital Negative) format is the only standardised RAW format – a potential ISO Standard of the future 
- All medium format, all DSLR’s and most Bridge and CSC cameras can produce RAW files, plus a number of high-end compact cameras now also have this capability
- Good flexibility for over & under exposure (great colour depth)
- Old RAW data files can be revisited and reprocessed as technology improves (software updates)
- With RAW data files most cameras record 12-bits or 14-bits per colour which will provide 4,096 or 8,192 levels respectively
- Metadata is also stored i.e. camera type, lens & focal length used, aperture and shutter
### JPEG - Joint Photographic Experts Group
- Standard for compressed continuous tone photo's
- Can achieve 10:1 image compression with only minor perceptible loss in image quality
- Format based on the Discrete Cosine Transform Algorithm (DCT)
- Produces image with good contrast & colour saturation yet sacrifices some image detail
- JPEG 2000 Wavelet-based compression method
### TIFF - Tagged Image File Format
- Industry standard for images destined for all commercial publishing
- Any resolution or bit depth can be stored using this file format (compressed or uncompressed)
- Designed for cross platform usage
- Although known for being uncompressed, it can be into LZW ( lempel-Ziv-Welch)
### GIF - Graphics Exchange Format
- Developed by Cimpurseve this bit-map image is designed for small scale images and therefore is ideal for publishing graphics and small thumbnail images on Web pages
- Can be preffered to JPEG for web usage
- Good for graphic images but is unsuitable for full colour images 
- Is a compressed LZW format
### PNG - Portable Interchange Format
- Another competiter to JPEG and GIF, with respect to web page images
- Improved compression enabling the saving of alpha mask channel information
- Higher colour bit-depths (24)
- Rapid downloading of images online
- Built in gamma correction
### PSD - Photoshop Document
- Native file for Adobe software
- Retains masking channel information that could be lost in other file formats
- Compression routines are lossless
- Used ecxtensively for digital printing, graphic design & high resolution digital photography

## Image Compression
### Lossless
Allows exact reconstruction of the pixel values (developed for the transmission of images from space probes)
### Lossy 
Capable of achieving very high compression ratio’s for images – information is compacted separately & it is colour information that is removed (greyscale info left untouched)
### Visually lossless compression
- transform method used for the Kodak Photo CD system 
- Format has one luminance (Y) and two chrominance (C1 & C2) components 
- C1 is unique to the red-green colour balance
- C2 is unique to the yellow-blue colour balance 
- The method relies upon the limitations of human vision with respect to colour i.e. removal of specific colour information whilst retaining the greyscale information

## Digital Camera Image Storage
- Memory Cards
- Four systems are currently being used in DSLR cameras:
	- Compact flash
	- Secure Digital (SD)
	- Memory Stick
	- xD Cards
### Compact Flash Memory
- Unofficial Standard for most memory cards
- Many cameras have a second card slot allowing for an alternative memory card
- Two types: CF-i (3.3mm) & CF-II (5mm)
- Predicted Lifespan ~100 years (between -25degC and 85degC)
- Largest Capacity = 256GB
### Secure Digital
- Aimed at the Prosemer DSLR, Bridge, CSC, Compact and mobile phone range of digital cameras
- These cards are minature therefore ideal for smaller systems
- Max storage = 512GB
- Many computers and DVD players are also setup to read this type of card
### Memory Stick
- Sony's propietry memory card system
- Only used for Sony's CSC, compact and DSLR cameras
- Their DSLR cameras also have a second slot for compact flash or SD memory cards
- Current largest storage = 512GB
### xD Memory Cards
- Joint development between Fuji and Olympus
- Therefore only these two companies thes them for their digital cameras
- Current Fuji and Olymups cameras use Secure Digital cards
- storage = 2GB

## Computer-Related Removable Data Storage
#### Early Systems
- Syquest Drive
- Zip Drive
- Jaz Drive
#### Current Systems
- Pen/Flash Drive
- Compact Disk (CD)
- Digital Versatile Disk (DVD)
- Blue-Ray Disk
- Tape Media
- Redundant Array of Independant Disks (RAID)
- External Hard Drive
### Flash Drive
- Keyring size USB solid state memory
- Very common for transferring and storing all forms of data
- Not ideal for archiving image files
- Kingston & San Disk are two large producers
### Compact Disk (CD)
- Optical storage method
- 700MB capacity
- Available Formats:
	- CD-R (Compact Disk Recordable)
	- CD-RW(Compact Disk Recordable Writable)
	- Kodak Photo CD
### Digital Versatile Disk (DVD)
- Optical storage method
- Designed for moving images but still ideal for still images
- 7 fold increase of CD capacity
- 9 fold increase of CD transfer rate
- Smaller wavelength and pit size than CD
- Essentially five recordable versions:
	- DVD-RAM – first rewritable format / uses phase-change technology and does not need to record a lead-in or a lead-out every time the disk is used
	- DVD-R and DVD-RW write once system / uses a special dye layer that is permanently changed by a red laser beam / has lead-in, user data and lead-out
	- DVD+R & DVD+RW - Highest compatibility of the three with write-once & rewritable modes. Some drives can now write to both +R &-R formats (designated as + - R)
### Blue-Ray Disk
- Optical storage method
- Created by the Blue Ray Disk Association 
- Was initially competing with HD-DVD
- System u
- used a blue-violet laser operating at a wavelength of 405nm
### Tape Media
- Magnetic storage technology
- Ideal for very large numbers of digital images
- High storage capacity and low cost
- High longevity
- High security
- Universally accepted storage method so should be around for a while
### Redundant Array of Independant Disks (RAID)
- Hardware + Software designed for high storage safely
- Magnetic storage system
- Stack of hard drives
- Has advantage that if a single disk crashes data can be rebuilt using remaining working drives
### External Hard Drive
- Electro-mechanical data storage device using magnetic storage
- Available as
	1. Desktop (rotate at 5,400 to 10,000 rpm)
	2. Mobile (rotate at 4,200 to 7, 200)
	3. Enterprise – used with multi-user computers (10,000 or 15,000 rpm)

## Cloud Storage
- Model of data storage where the physical storage spans multiple servers and possibly multiple locations
- Physical environment owned and managed by a hosting company
- Off-premises service – Amazon S3
- On-premises service – ViON Capacity Services
- Made up from many distributed resources but acting as one (federated/cooperative)
- Highly fault tolerant 
- Highly durable
- Providers responsible for keeping data available and to ensure it is readily accessible
- Examples:
	- Dropbox – all digital files
	- Google Drive – all digital files
	- Microsoft One-Drive – all digital files
	- Flickr – photo’s (JPEG only) and videos
