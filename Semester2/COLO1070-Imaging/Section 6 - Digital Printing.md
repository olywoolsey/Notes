## Electrophotography
- Involves the use of both light and electrostatic charge 
- Five key stages:
	1. Photoconductor drum receives a uniform electrostatic charge  
	2. Laser writes image information onto drum  
	3. A latent electrostatic image is generated in both the uncharged and charged areas of the drum
	4. Latent image made  visible by means of a  toner, which is repelled to the uncharged image  areas 
	5. Toner-filled image areas then transferred to the oppositely charged  paper surface  
	6. After transfer the toner is  fused to the paper surface via heated pressure rollers
- Dry toner technology – originally developed for photocopiers and then utilised for desktop laser printers.  
- Liquid toner technology – only commercial system using this is the HP Indigo digital press

## Print Systems incorporating Silver Halide Technology
- In the early days of digital  printing the non-impact printing  technologies were perceived as  being inferior to conventional  silver halide printing  
- This situation has now largely been rectified  
- The four key criteria that need to be satisfied for a successful photo-quality printing system are  as follows:  
- Photo-realistic appearance and feel  
- Print output speed  
- Image stability and longevity  
- Cost factors

## Fuji Pictrography Imaging System
- Silver halide based  imaging technology that  incorporates both photothermography and dye diffusion principles  
- Has key advantage over traditional RA-4 wet processing chemistry in processing speed  
- Niche market areas where low volume of prints required i.e. photographic studios, retail stores, aerial photography etc
- Exposure of the donor  material, which contains  a three-layer gelatin  emulsion sensitive to  red, green, blue &  infrared, by an array of  three colour laser diodes  
- This enables the formation of a latent image within each gelatin emulsion layers  
- Each layer is exposed to one of 256 different brightness levels resulting in 16.7 million possible colours
- The donor sheet is then sandwiched with the receiving layer and thermally processed between 80ºC & 90ºC for 25/30 seconds 
- This process causes the latent image to develop 
- The azo dyes with dye- releasing redox groups are activated by the heat/alkaline environment causing the DRR groups to reduce the exposed silver ions to silver, releasing the dyes
- With the aid of a small  volume of water, the  cyan, yellow and magenta dyes diffuse into the receptor layer – here the dyes are anchored by means of ionic bonding to cationic polymeric mordants present in the receiving layer  
- The donor sheet and receiving layer are then peeled apart

## Digital Exposure to Photographic Processes
- Different from analogue  equivalent in that the film  negative is replaced by a digital file and the photographic enlarger lighting is replaced by the use of lasers, laser diodes, or light emitting diodes [LED’s]  
- Image exposure based upon additive principle of colour mixing – involves exposure of individual pixels of the file to a photographic material (paper/film) by modulated

## Durst Lambda Printers
- Constant intensity RGB lasers used  
- Each laser passes through a modulator which alters the input brightness to one of 256 levels of output brightness that correspond to the individual RGB values of each pixel of the 24-bit digital file  
- The three beams then converge when exposing the photographic paper

## Océ LightJet Printer
- Produces C-prints over 48" wide  
- Uses a laser to write the image onto AgX photographic paper using an internal tilted 270° drum  
- Laser light reflected by a spinning mirror moves along the axis of the cylinder onto the surface of the media  
- Excellent image sharpness plus uniform density and colour

## Lumejet Printer
- Uses multiple-parallel independent beams of photons of various wavelengths and spot sizes to generate the image  
- The multi-LED exposure head is approximately the size of an inkjet cartridge  
- Works in a similar fashion to inkjet printing but sprays light onto photo- sensitive silver halide media instead of ink onto ink receivable coated papers
![[Pasted image 20230327153003.png]]
- As with inkjet, the multi-LED exposure head can move and traverse the media (for large format printing), or be mounted in a static bar configuration while the media passes underneath (ideal for high-speed printing)
- In the moving head version, light (photons) from an LED array is directed through a custom designed fibre-optic taper and focused onto the media via a 1:1 relay lens
- Lumejet’s digital print head technology comprises a solid-state, multi-LED exposure head with unique fibre-taper optics 
- Uses RGB colour space and is ICC profiled  
-  Excellent colour fidelity including difficult Pantone spot colours such as Reflex blue, metallics & pastel colours  
- 400 dpi resolution – ideal for fine art prints & wedding photography

## Image Stability & Print Durability of Photo-realistic Print
- Image Durability refers of the print to a range of environmental factors that degrade the image appearance
- Print durability relates to the physical resistance of the media against things like physical abrasion and human fingerprints
- As a print is comprised of the ink (colourant + binder), the media (support + IRL) & a possible finishing medium (laminate), it will be the weakest link that dictates the lifespan of the print
- weakest link will depend on the environment its stored in

### Visible Light & UV Radiation
- Viewed as the most important factor with respect to image stability  
- A great deal of attention has focused on ink jet photo-realistic prints  
- Visible light & UV radiation proved to be the greatest threat to all photographic images from the very early days ( e.g. Fox Talbot Calotype), particularly colour photographic systems
- There are three common mechanisms associated with exposure to visible light & ultra- violet radiation:  
	- Photo-oxidation, photo-reduction & UV-related bond cleavage 
	- Photo-oxidation & photo-reduction  mechanisms cause the dye/pigment  colourants to fade but usually also  require the presence of both water  & oxygen  
	- Fade process brought about by reactions that break the colourants down to components that will have different absorption (dyes) or reflectance properties (pigments) to the original colourants
- Dye colourants fade faster than pigment colourants  
- Dyes exist on the IRL as a single molecule or as a very small aggregate (reaction with mordant layer) 
- Pigments exist as crystalline particulates thus only a very small percentage of the molecules that make up the actual particles will be present at the surface  
- Catalytic fading associated with dye-based ink jet inks is caused by mixed colourants  
- Tends to occur in darker areas where more dye is present and hence the individual dyes are more prone to reacting with one another

### Temperature and Relative Humidity
- Principle components in the deterioration of images stored in the dark [Dark Fading – photo albums etc]
- Also factors in the fading of colourants in the presence of light  
- These conditions enhance the chemical reaction potential of molecules present in the IRL’s of ink jet prints e.g. residual solvents - leads to colorant fade and breakdown of paper fibres & polymer coatings  
- High humidity encourages dye migration & bacterial growth  
- High temperature & low relative humidity encourages drying out of prints leading to mechanical stress

### Water
- Moisture is the most likely  form of water to be encountered in the majority of print storage situations 
- However, it is always possible that water in the form of a drinks spillage, or even human saliva, could reach the surface of a print – not a serious problem for a pigment - based image but a real threat to a dye-based image

### Air Pollution
- Major factor for dye-based images on micro-porous IRL’s  
- Major culprit is ozone but other air pollutants such as nitrogen oxides, peroxides & sulphur oxides are also potential contributors to the chemical degradation of the organic colourants (all dyes and certain pigments types), along with polymeric binders
