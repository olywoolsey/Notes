### The Camera Obscura
- first used by an Arabian scholar Ibn Al-Haytham in 1021AD
- a darkened room with a hole in a wall which projects an image of outside onto the opposite wall
- commonly used by other painters like Leonardo de-vinchi
### +Lens
- Giovanni Della Porta is credited with the idea of a lens instead of a hole
- thus a portable apparatus became available
- became a light-tight box with lens

## Composition of white light
- between 1664 and 1672 Issac Newton discovered composition of white light through a prism

## 1st Camera Design
- Johann Zahn envisioned a box that was portable - ie first camera design
- 150 yrs before first actual camera

## Photochemistry
- Heinrich Schuize
- observed that darkening of silver salts was due to light
- previous thoughts was heat of sun or air
- very slow

## New Lens System
- John Dolland
- devised a new lens system
- gave the image less chromatic aberration that caused colour fringing in earlier lenses
- axial aberration causes light of different colours to fall in different planes of focus

## Contact Copying
- Thomas Wedgewood
- copied silhouettes of leaves sensitised with silver nitrate
- Humphry David produced a paper about it

## First Permanent photo
- Nicephore Niepice
- succeed with silver chloride fixation was only temporary 
- used bitumen of Judea which hardened under influence of light
- took a whole day take as shadows go all day

## The Term Photography
- Florance Herecles
- first person to use the term
- was working in Brazil

## The Daguerreotype
- invented by Louis Jacques Mande Daguerre
- a cylinder where you can stand in the middle and have a panoramic view of a screen
- first commercial photographic system
- latent image developed using mercury vapour
- exposure was 20/30 minutes
- initially fixed using common salt solution
#### Full Process
- silvered copper plate sensitised with iodine vapour
	- forms silver iodide on plate
- following camera exposure mercury attaches itself to silver iodide exposed in the light
- the image is fixed using hyposulphite of soda -replacing original common salt solution
### Disadvantages
- has to be viewed by reflected light from silver copper plate
- as direct positive the image was mirrored
- can't produce additional copies
- as it took so long they would often clamp peoples heads or other parts of the body into place
>$1^{st}$ areal image
>In 1837 a French photographer Gaspard Felix Tournachon (pseudonym – Nadar) recorded the first aerial photograph from a tethered balloon (Place De L’Etolie – Paris)

## Calotype Process
- developed by William Henry Fox Talbot in 1841
- not on metal was on paper
- the first negative/positive process
- can reproduce it 
- Steps:
1. Involved the coating of writing paper with a solution of AgX followed by impregnation with Ag Nitrate & Gallic acid
2. Following light exposure the paper was developed in a solution of gallo-nitrate of Ag
3. Fixation by potassium bromide – later hyposulphite of soda
4. Produced a paper negative from which a paper positive could be produced
>$1^{st}$ operation with anaesthetic - 1846

## Wet Collodion Process
- Frederick Scott Archer - 1851
- Potassium iodide dissolved in collodion (viscous solution poured over glass plate)
- Plate then bathed in a solution of Ag nitrate
- Ag iodide precipitated in the collodion resulting in an effective photographic plate (processed in similar fashion to the Calotype)
- plates very sensitive - only a few seconds
- created photo journalism and street photography
#### Major disadvantage 
- the plates had to be coated,exposed and developed on the spot (sensitivity deteriorated very quickly once the collodion started to dry)
> Rodger Fenton - famous but only ever photographed the Crimean War
> Also many Celebrity Photographs that weren't around before as it took way less time

## Ambrotype & Tintype
- Ambrotype is a bleached collodion negative on glass with dark paper behind to produce a positive image
- Tintype (or Ferreotype) is a bleached collodion negative on tin plate coated with black paint to produce a positive image

## Colour Photography
### RGB - Additive
- Most photographic historians agree that the onset of present day colour photography goes back to 1861 when James Clerk-Maxwell demonstrated, in a lecture given to the Royal Institution, that photographic records could be used to analyse and then synthesise all colours present by the use of Red light, Green light and Blue light
- started off by photographing them separately on each filter then adds them back together
### CYM - Subtractive
- 1869 - put patent in the book "Les Couleurs en Photographie, Solution de Probleme” before doing any theory
- He identified that pigments absorb all their colours except their own, which they reflect
- couldn't get the primary colours exactly right

## Gelatin
- changed from collodion to gelatin as an emulsion binder
- no improvement but is more readily available so became more popular
- the first dry plates
- over time the process was sped up

## Dye Sensitisation
- 1873 - Dr Hermann Wilhelm Vogel realised hat dye corralline 
- made sure all light that went through the filter couldn't get back through
- dye added to emulsion to reduce hallation

## Photographic Studies of motion
- Edweard Maybridge - 1877-1879
- set up experiment with 12 cameras to prove that all four hooves of a horse came off the ground

## Roll Film
- 1884 - George Eastman
- roll film used paper as the emulsion support substrate
- then took to a processing house to get developed

## Kodak
- can pronounce in any language
- 1888
- single shutter speed of 1/$125^{th}$ of a second
- a fixed focus lens
- aimed at a mass population, was relativity cheap and easy to use

## First Moving Pictures on Paper Film
- Louis Le Prince
- took the first moving image
- short film of traffic crossing Leeds bridge
- known as father of cinematography

## More Film Types
### 1889
- not paper - cellulose nitrate
- potentially dangerous - flash point of $4.4^{o}c$
- started thinking about motion picture
- when storing many motion pictures there were many fires
### 1891
- cellulose diacetate as a roll film base material for still image photography 
- controlled 80 - 90 % of the market

## Interference Process
- Professor Gabriel Lippmann in 1891
- produced a natural without dyes or filters
- took a long time so couldn't become commercial

## Line Screen
- Professor John Jolly - 1894
- Was unsuccessful due to engineering limitations of the day i.e. only 200 lines per inch achievable
- Forerunner to similar successful commercial processes, most notably the DUFAY COLOUR Process
- lines were too thick so could see in image

- Only on sale for few years, yet selling 40,000 plates in 1911 alone
- The system was around for over 40 years, with the most successful product being the DUFAYCOLOR process

## Leica comes in
- 1923
- Designed by Oskar Barnack it was the first film camera to use 35 mm perforated film (originally designed for cinematographic use)
- The launch was a major breakthrough in photography, with the 35 mm format becoming a dominant force
- Key advantages were cheaper film and the ability to record images without the use of a tripod

- Both awarded the Nobel Prize for Physics in 2009

## Polacolor sx-70 Process
- The Polacolor system was superseded in 1972 by the Polacolor SX-70 process which involved the negative & receiving sheet being incorporated within an integral pack
- Thus ‘peel-apart’became obsolete
