## Lens imperfections 
### direct aberrations
affect all parts of the field of view
- Chromatic aberration (axial)
	- focus for the blue light is closer to the lens than the focus for the red light
- Spherical aberration
	- rays in edge wont be as in focus
	- stopped by using flat lens but very expensive
### oblique aberrations
not present within the centre of the field of view
- Chromatic aberration (lateral)
	- light separated at the edges
- Curvature of field
- Astigmatism
	- where two rays that propagate in perpendicular planes have different foci
	- stretch image in different directions
- Coma
- Curvilinear distortion
	- with wide angle lenses then lines would curve out
	- telephoto lens would curve inwards

## Designer Issues
- Image Quality
- Coverage of image area ( equal quality inside and outside of photo)
- level of consistency over wide range of subject distances
- acceptability of the widest aperture
- weight and size limitations

## Basic Materials
- highly transparent
- suitable refraction properties
- pioneering work by Abbe Schott and Ziess - 1880s
- have low and high refractive index
- low and high dispersion
- performance of glass depends on RI and dispersion property
- density
- resistance to staining
- homogeneity of raw materials

## Zoom Lense
- Variable focal length – works by moving internal glass elements
- Complex with respect to the optics:
	1. The focused subject must not change when focal length is altered
	2. The diaphragm must widen, or narrow, to keep the f-number constant
- Aberration corrections must adjust or maintain acceptable image quality throughout the range of subject distances and focal length
- Zoom lenses are extremely popular with respect to 35mm SLR and DSLR photography
- Latest stats indicate that Zoom lenses outsell all fixed focal length lenses by around 3:1
- Zoom lenses in the focal length range from 50 to 210mm are the most readily available, although Wide-angle Zoom lenses are becoming ever more popular
### Advantages
- Within the limits of a particular zoom range there is offered a continuous change of image size
- The instantaneous ability to frame-up action shots, sports images, candid shots etc without recourse to changing the lens
- Less requirement to carry a range of fixed focal length lenses
- The ability to create special effects by zooming in, or out,during the exposure
- Most Zoom lenses have macro-mode capability
### Disadvantages
- The widest aperture is usually of the order of 1 to 1½stops smaller than a standard fixed focal length lens e.g. f3.5 instead of f2
- More expensive and more bulky than any one fixed focal length lens within its own range
- Less expensive models reveal poor image contrast and definition
- Continuous use of a Zoom lens tends to reduce the operators sense of perspective
- Choice of viewpoint and depth of field compromised

## Mirror Lenses
- Often referred to as a catadioptric lens
- Fixed Focal Length
- chromatic aberration does not occur
- typically has a focal length of 500 mm and a aperture of f5.6 f8
- extreme have 1000mm focal length and aperture of f11
- mirror reflection reduces mirror contrast
- also create doughnuts ( out of focus highlights)

## Fish-eye lenses
- purposeful distortion
- extreme wide angle
- developed to create pictures of cloud formations as could have 180* hemisphere
- often in peepholes

## Macro Lenses
- especially designed for photographing micro-life eg: flora and fauna
- true macro is 1:1 - size of object reproduced life size on film/sensor
- have a long focusing range from about 20cm to infinity
- can't use normal flash so use ring flash instead
- Other methods of obtaining macro images are as follows:
	- Bellows (see opposite)
	- Extension tubes
	- Close-up lenses (Dioptres)
	- Lens reversal – using reversal ring

## Lens Coating
- The key problem is the different refractive index (RI) value for Glass (1.0) and Air (1.5)
- This causes around 4% of incoming light to be reflected at each element surface (lens could have 20-30 elements!)
- Ideal coating needs to have RI of 1.25
- Most readily available material– Magnesium Fluoride (RI 1.38)
- Fluoropolymers (RI 1.3) are more expensive & difficult to apply
### How many
- Single layer coating -reduces light reflection from 4% to ~1.5%
- Multi-layer coating –reduces light reflection from 4% to ~0.2%
- Nano coatings will reduce light reflection from 4% to < 0.1%

## Focusing Fundamentals
- Almost all [cameras](Cameras.md) have a built in focusing mechanism
- Exceptions include pin-hole and basic point and shoot camera models
- allows control of image and sharpness
- for portraits always focus on the eyes - auto focus will often focus on the nose
- Bokeh quality - the impact of a 3D image represented in a 2D plane
- Focusing involves adjusting the plane of sharp focus either by moving it nearer to the camera (for close-up’s)or further away (for distant views)
- With both manual and automatic focus, inward &outward motion of the lens is achieved via a threaded barrel
- The focus moves from infinity to ~1-2 metres from the camera
- Many cameras have a built-in focusing aid for manual focusing
![[Images/Pasted image 20230306152357.png]]
- mirror moves out the way when picture is taken
- The viewing screens have incorporated into them a Focusing Screen of which there are a range of types available
- The most common in corporate three elements
	1. Split prism finder – shows displacement of an out-of-focus subject
	2. Plain screen – for detailed slower focusing
	3. Micro-prism grid –scrambles unfocused images

## Automatic Focusing
- The system works by means of one or more (array) sensors
- High-end SLR & DSLR cameras can have over 50 auto focus points (see below)
- Simple cameras may only have a single auto focus point
- Changes in contrast at different points are measured
- Maximum contrast =Maximum sharpness
![[Images/Pasted image 20230306152855.png]]
- Three important factors that affect auto focus performance:
	1. The level of light available
	2. The level of contrast associated with the subject
	3. The motion of the subject or the motion of the camera
- Two types of auto-focus sensors: 
	1. Cross-type (+) which performs two-dimensional contrast detection = high accuracy
	2. Vertical line (-) which performs one-dimensional contrast detection = lower accuracy
- Some cameras have an autofocus assist beam – normally uses Infrared laser beam to assist auto-focus sensors detect the subject matter
	- Very useful for low light detection and also for low contrast images

## Shutter Principles
- early cameras didn't have the shutter mechanism - original reason for the lens cap
- as photographic emulsion speeds increased a shutter mechanism became essential
- this is to protect the film/sensor from light until the moment of exposure
- most shutters will cover from 8 seconds to 1/8000th of a second
- Shutter speeds either double(1/125th to 1/250th) or halve(1/1000th to 1/500th)
- This is key because it coincides with the doubling/halving of the lens aperture
- This leads to a simplification of exposure calculation as changing from one speed (or aperture) to the next either doubles or halves the level of light exposure
- The mechanism for control of shutter speed is mechanical or electro-mechanical
### Slow Speed Images
- The other common symbol for shutter speeds is the letter B (on SLR’s) or Bulb setting (on DSLR’S)
- This allows the shutter to beheld held open by a shutter release cable

## Focal Plane Shutter
- sits in the body of the camera - independent of the lens
- resembles roller blinds - made from fabric, metal plates or thin aluminium sheets
- composed of two blinds
- prior to exposure the lower blind is unwound and covers the film/sensor plane
- the upper blind is fully rolled up
| Shutter speed (sec)  | Photographic Situation                                                                  |
| -------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1 to 30 +            | Speciality night photography, low light photography, firework displays– tripod required |
| 2 to 1/2             | The ability to slow water down(waterfalls, fountains etc) – tripod required             |
| 1/2 to 1/30th        | To add motion blur to the background of a moving subject –hand held with stabilisation  |
| 1/50th to 1/100th    | Typical hand held photographs in good lighting                                          |
| 1/250th to 1/500th   | To freeze everyday sports/action subject movement – hand held with zoom capability      |
| 1/1000th to 1/4000th | To freeze extremely fast up-close subjects in motion – hand held                        |

### Slow Shutter Speeds
- At shutter speeds of 1/125th second or slower, the shutter uncovers the film/sensor completely before beginning to close
- If a flashgun is being used it will fire the moment the shutter is fully open
![[Images/Pasted image 20230306155147.png]]

### Fast Shutter Speeds
Action of shutter quite different 
Thus at 1/250th second or faster, a narrow slit moves quickly across in front of the film/sensor (lower blind rolls up & upper blind unrolls)
As this blind combination is never fully open – a flash gun cannot be used
![[Images/Pasted image 20230306155256.png]]

### Leaf Shutter
- Associated with the lens & located between the lens elements
- Constructed of a number of overlapping thin metal plates which prevent light from passing through to the film/sensor
- When the shutter is activated the leaves spring open to allow light to pass through
- Maximum speed 1/1000th second
- Associated with medium format and large format cameras
### Camera Shutters
- DSLR cameras have electro-mechanical shutters similar to SLR cameras
- Compact digital cameras have electronic shutters
- These can be global type (for high speed moving objects) or rolling type (for static or slow moving objects)

## Aperture & Exposure
- Lens aperture in combination with the camera shutter control the level of light reaching the film/sensor
- Control of the aperture size in determined by the Iris Diaphram which is a series of cresent shaped blades that make a circular opening in the centre of the lens
- Small apertures e.g. f22 let in low light levels but give good depth of field
- LArge apertures e.g. f2.8 let in more light but give poor depth of field
- With 35mm cameras the Iris Diaphram reamains fully open until the expesure ad then the apeture closes down to the selected apeture (specific to SLR & DSLR)
- Aperture ring on the lens is calibrated with a series of numbers called f-stops
- These are measures of the lens aperture
- The aeries normally starts at f1.2, f1.4,  f1.8 or f2 (fully open) & increases in stages to f2.8, f4, f5.6, f8, f16, f22 (even f32 & f64 with some lenses)
- If we were only limited to f-stops that were full stops, the scale would look like this:
	f/1, f/1.4, f/2, f/2.8, f/4, f/5.6, f/8, f/11, f/16, f/22, f/32
![[Images/Pasted image 20230502220655.png]]
- Each setting of the aperture ring from f22 towards f1.8 allows twice as much light through as the previous setting
- Thus at f8 the level of light reaching the film/sensor is double that at f11 but only half that at f5.6
- Note the similarity here to the doubling/halving associated with shutter speeds
- Thus if the cameras light meter indicates that the correct exposure can be achieved by a combination of 1/60th second at f5.6, then equal exposure can also be achieved by a combination of 1/125th second at f4
- However, the depth of field will be greater for the 1/60th second at f5.6

## Depth of field
- Governed by aperture setting
- A wide aperture such as f1.8 gives an inferior DOF compared with a narrow aperture such as f22
- Other factors include lens focal length, subject distance & degree of print enlagement
- A 300mm telephoto lens will have a shallower DOF than a 24 mm wide-angle lens
![[Images/Pasted image 20230502221134.png]]

## Camera Exposure Modes
- Auto: the camera automatically selects all the exposure settings
- Program(P): camera automatically select Aperture and the shutter speed - you choose corresponding ISO speed and any exposure compensation required
- Aperture Priority: You select the Aperture and ISO the cameras metering determins the corresponding shutter speed
- Shutter Priority: You specify the Shutter Speed and ISO and the camera's metering determins the corresponding Aperture
- Manual: You select the Aperture, ISO and Shutter Speed

## Image Stabilisation
- Lens-based optical image stabilisation (OIS)
	- Achieved by means of a single floating lens element positioned within the compound lens
	- The lens shifts to compensate for the camera and hence image movement
- Camera-based image stabilisation
	- Here the sensor moves to compensate for the shaky camera movement instead of the lens
	- however the degree of correction is less than an OIS system
- Electronic image stabilisation (EIS)
	- Achieved by software processing
	- The system works to redice blur on the captured pixels that make up the image
