## Camera Filters
The action of a camera can be compared to the human eye
Features common to both are as below:
	1. An adjustable lens
	2. Formation of an inverted image
	3. A light-sensitive medium at the rear of the lens

## Eye Features

## Camera Filters
- one of the main differences between the camera and the eye is that the eye can adapt to different lighting conditions yet ligh t sensitive film medium cannot and digital imaging sesnors have limitations too 
- Thus there is a need for filters to cater for this imbalance - especially with film cameras
- Filters are available in variety of different materials:
	1. Dyed gelatin or polyester sheets- available within a range of sizes
	2. Optical glass fitted within a circular metal mount– screws onto the front rim of the lens & available within a range of qualities & sizes
	3. Optical resin – available with purpose built filter holder
	4. Key manufacturers B+W, Cokin, Hoya, Lee,Cromatek and Tiffen

### For monochrome
- Basic rule with colour filters is that a filter passes light matching its own colour & absorbs (darkens)other colours – in particular those colours furthest away in the visible spectrum
- Film is more sensitive to blue than the human eye which leads to blue sky and white clouds being recorded much paler than witnessed by the eye
- The use of a K2 yellow filter corrects this whereby light is absorbed by the filter, making the clouds look more pronounced against a darker blue sky
- A further effect along similar lines is to use a Green filter (X1) which will also darken the sky and in addition lighten a foreground containing greenery i.e.fields/woodlands etc
- Whereas the yellow K2 filter acts strictly as a correction filter when used to ensure that the blue sky appears as the eye sees it, both orange & red filters act as contrast increase filters
- The Orange G filter darkens the blue sky even more and the Red 25A filter converts the blue sky to almost black

## Lighting
- Light sources used for photography are referred to as white light sources – they produce a mixture of all colours and a continuous spectrum
- The colour of the white light source is measured in degrees Kelvin (K) – starting at absolute zero(-273°C)
- Derived from the heating of metal – colour changes at increasing temperatures –red/orange/yellow/white/blue

## In-Camera Filtration specific for Colour Film Photography
- The use of colour filters with colour negative & colour transparency films can be divided into two categories:
	1. Colour correction conversion filters
	2. Colour correction compensating filters

## Colour Correction Conversion Filters
- All colour films are balanced for specific light sources and as long as film is used with its recommended light source, the use of filters is minimal
- If a different light source has to be used, colour correction can be achieved using a relevant colour temperature conversion filter
- These filters effectively change the colour temperature to match that light source for which the film is balanced
- An example would be a daylight balanced film(5500K) used with tungsten lighting (3200K)for which an 80A filter is required to convert the light source
- For the use of daylight balanced colour film with artificial lightsources
- 80A for use with 3200K lamps
- 80B for use with 3400K lamps
- For the use of tungsten balanced colour films in daylight
- 85 decreases the colour temperature from 5500K to 3400K for Type A films
- 85B converts 5500K to 3200K for Type B films
- Conversion filters with odd reference numbers(81A & 85B) are yellow/orange in colour for lowering the colour temperature (K) of the light source
- Conversion filters with even reference numbers(80A & 8OB) are blue to raise the colour temperature (K) of the light source
- Much paler filters -purpose is to control either the red, green or blue part of the visible spectrum and allow the other two colours to pass through
- Available in six colours –each containing various colour strengths
- Used to provide fine lighting adjustments
- When using daylight film with fluorescent lighting,a greenish colour cast is prevalent
- If the fluorescent lamp is a warm white type a compensating filter combination of 40C +40M will correct the green hue

## In-camera Filtration for film and Digital Image Capture
1. Ultraviolet Filter
	- Appears as plain glass and absorbs a radiation that is not visible
	- All film types are sensitive to UV radiation, with the upper emulsion layer being most vulnerable – in colour film results in excess blue appearance
	- The filter removes this blue tint and for monochrome films it has the effect of cutting through haze to improve image clarity 
	- Excellent also for lens protection
	- Skylight 1A and 1B Filters
		- Also reduceexcessive bluish-ness
		- Absorption peak isin the green/yellow part of the spectrum meaning better skin tones with outdoor photo’s
2. Neutral Density Filters
	- Grey colourless filters for reducing the level of light passing through the camera lens
	- Do not effect the colour balance of the scene
3. Polarising Filter
	- Allows or prevents specific direction light wavesthrough the camera lens
	- When light waves are parallel to the plane in which polarised light is vibrating, light is transmitted
	- When at right angles the polarized light cannot pass
	- Rotate filter until unwanted reflections disappear or until sky darkens
	- if you don't want reflections you should take the picture at 90 degrees to the sun
4. Soft-Focus Filter
	- Essentially used to create an ethereal mood to both landscape and portrait images(excellent for hiding skin blemishes etc)
	- Works by means of distorting the light
	- The optical glass will contain one of the following: dents, bubbles, ripples or fine black mesh within the glass
	-  Lensbaby
		- Neither filter or lens
		- Works by bringing just one area of the image into sharp focus, with the rest of the image being diffused with glowing highlights
5. Close Up Filters
	- Work by shifting the camera’s plane of focus from infinity to the distance corresponding tothe focal length of the filter
	- Available in+1 to +4 Dioptre’s (optician’s unit of measurement)
6. Graduated Filters
	- Specifically deigned to equal the contrast in light between the fore groundsection and the sky section of an image
	- Available as both graduated neutral density filters and as colour graduating filters
	- Neutral Density Graduated Filters
		- Able to lower contrast in bright skies
		- Most common strengths = 0.3, 0.6& 0.9
	- Colour Graduated Filters
		- Purely for creative effects although they do lower image contrast between the sky and foreground
		- Ideal for adding colour and mood to a bland sky scape

## In-Computer Filtration For Digital Images
- Filters used for post-production work on digital images
- Image manipulation software programmes such as Adobe Photoshop® already have a number of essential filters for photo editing but many additional filter plug-ins are also available
### Image and Saturation Filteration
- Hue, Saturation and Brightness are all key aspects of colour in the Additive principle of colour reproduction (RGB)
- The Hue/Saturation filtration can deliver an image of greater impact if the original lighting was of inferior quality
- Hue = pure colour, Saturation = intensity or dilution of colour, Lightness = adding black or white to darken or lighten the image
### Artistic Filters
- these are used to apply a level of abstraction to digital images
- the ajustment of brush size, texture and intenstiy ate pivotal to the resulting image
- extremely effective with portrait images ( when used with restraint)
### Blur Filters
- Used essentially to draw attention to a particular aspect of a digital image
- A typical example would be to blur a background to draw attention to a feature in the foreground(similar to the use of selective apertures on a camera) – Gaussian Blur
- Used also to reduce skin imperfections in portrait images (Surface Blur) and add movement to an image (Radial Blur/Motion Blur)

### Texture and Pixelate Filters
- In essence creating ‘painterly’ effects to the image
- For the texture filters, these include grain and stain glass effects
- For the pixelate filters, these include crystallize and pointillize

## Rise of mobile apps
- The ability to produce vibrant images from dull smartphone photos 
- At least 752 photography apps are available in the iTunes store
- Examples: Instagram, Hipstamatic, QuickCamera, Photosynth, Slow Shutter Cam,SneakyPix, Snapseed, Filterstorm,PhotoWizard and Touch Retouch
