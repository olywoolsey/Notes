- Domain: the input set
- Co-domain: every possible outcome
- Range: the sets that are outputted from the function
- Range: set of all images of elements of A
- F: A $\rightarrow$ B = $f(a)=b$
- for $f(a)=B$
	- a is the image of b
	- b is the image of a
### Injective
- no two elements will be mapped to the same elements
- can have a bigger co-domain than range
### Surjective
- Range and co-domain are equal
- some elements can map to the same element
- every element in the co-domain has a mapping from A to it
### Bijective
- both injective and surjective
- every element of A will map to an element in the co-domain

A function is called real-valued if its co-domain is the set of real numbers, and it is called integer-valued if its co-domain is the set of integers.
Two real-valued functions or two integer-valued functions with the same domain can be added, as well as multiplied.

### Identity Function
- If $A$ is a set, the function i<sub>A</sub> $:A \rightarrow A$ is the identity function for i<sub>A</sub>(x) = x for all $x \in A$

### Inverse Function
- $f : \mathbb{R} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ where $f(x) = x -2$
- then $f$<sup>-1</sup>$(y) = y + 2$ 
- for all $y \in \mathbb{R} we have $f^{-1} o f = {i}_\mathbb{R}$ 
#### Equivilentces
- $f$ is invertable
- $f$ is bijective
- there excists a function $g : B \rightarrow A$ with $(gof) = i_A$ and $(fog) = i_B$

### Applying Maths
- $(f+g)(x) := f(x) + g(x)$
- $(f * g)(x) := f(x) * g(x)$
- $g o f  =  f(g(x))$
