# Greedy Algorithms
#COMP2721 
## Paradigm
- Build a solution incrementally by choosing the next solution component using alocal and not forward-looking criteria
- Take a solution that looks locally optimal
- works for problems, where a non-optimal solution can be improved to an optimalsolution by incrementally replacing locally non-optimal solution components
- leads to very efficient algorithms
## Minimum Spanning Tree
Given a connected, undirected graph a MST is the graph that connects all the nodes with the lowest total edge weight
