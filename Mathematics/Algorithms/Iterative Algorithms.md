# Iterative Algorithms
#COMP2711 
## Overview
Unlike [Recursive Algorithms](Recursive%20Algorithms.md), which is a repetitive process that calls itself; [Iterative Algorithms](Iterative%20Algorithms.md), consists of statements repeated a number of times in a loop.
## Simple Loops
[[Big O]] for both is O(n)
### For Loop
for $i\leftarrow 1$ to n do
	application code
### While Loop
i $\leftarrow$ 1
while $i\leftarrow$ n do
	application code 
	$i \leftarrow i + 1$
## Nested Loops
- A loop within a loop
for $i\leftarrow 1$ to n do
	for $j\leftarrow 1$ to n do
		 application code
