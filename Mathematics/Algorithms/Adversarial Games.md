# Adversarial Games
## Properties
- 2 Players (unless stated)
- Time limitations (either per move or whole game)

## Strategy
- Doesn't have to be good, a strategy
- Can depend on the opponents strategy
- **Winning Strategy:** one that will always win the game whatever moves the opponent(s) play
	- There cannot be a winning strategy for both players
	- A winning strategy may occur part way through the game

## Minimax
- Moving to position with highest minimax value gives best achievable payoff assuming that the opponent always makes their best play
- Look ahead approaches (such as MiniMax) tend to do badly at the endgame play of chess.  
- Endgame strategies can involve quite long sequences of moves where a player gradually forces their opponent into a losing position
