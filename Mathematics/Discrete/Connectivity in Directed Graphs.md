# Connectivity in Directed Graphs
- Directed Reachability: Find all nodes that can be reached from a given node s.
- Directed shortest s-t path: Find a shortest path from s to t for two given nodes s and t.
- Search in directed graphs: BFS and DFS can also be applied for directed graphs.
## Strong Connectivity
- Definition: Two nodes u and v are strongly connected if there is a path from u to v and vice versa.
- Definition: A directed graph is strongly connected if every pair of nodes is strongly connected.
- Remark: A directed graph is called weakly connected if the underlying un-directed graph, i.e., the un-directed graph that one obtains by ignoring the direction of edges, is connected
