# Process Synchronisation
#COMP2211
- Multiple [Threads](Threads.md) may want to update data at the same time
## Race Conditions
- When several processes manipulate data concurrently
- Outcomes can change on a different run of a multi-thread application
- Can arise in OS as different parts manipulate shared resources
- Also arise in multi-threaded user applications
## Critical Section Problem
Consider a system with n processes/threads $P_0, P_1, ..., P_{nâˆ’1}$.
- Each process has a critical section of code.
- In that section, shared data is being accessed (shared among at least two processes).
- When a process is executing instructions in the critical section, no other process can do so.
- Each process must request permission to enter their critical section
```c
while(true)
{
	// Implements the request
	ENTRY SECTION
		CRITICAL SECTION
	// May do sometidying up after the critical section
	EXIT SECTION
	// Rest of code
	remander section
}
```
