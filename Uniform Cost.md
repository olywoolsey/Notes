Although closely related randomness and uncertainty are not the  
same thing.  
The term ‘randomness’ is usually applied to situations where the  
range and frequency of outcomes is known. For instance, when  
rolling a standard die, each of the numbers 1–6 occurs with 1/6  
probability  
Taking into account the randomness of a dice roll is in most cases  
easier to model than the uncertainty of not knowing what your  
opponent will do in a given situation
