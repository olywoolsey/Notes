# Context Free Language

In the context of formal languages, a language is a set of strings of symbols over an alphabet. For example, the set of all strings over the alphabet $\{\texttt{a}, \texttt{b}, \texttt{c}, \ldots, \texttt{z}\}$ that contain an even number of a's and an odd number of b's is a language.

Languages can be classified based on the kinds of patterns that they contain. As we saw in the previous section the languages which can be recognised by deterministic finite state automata are [Regular Languages](Regular%20Languages.md). We define a class of languages which can be generated by context-free grammars.

> [!Info] Definition
> A language is called a **context-free language** (CFL) if some context-free grammar generates it.

If there does not exists a context-free grammar that generates a given language $L$, then $L$ is said to be **non-context-free**. 

The **language of a grammar**, denoted $L(G)$ (a slight corruption of notation), is $\{w \in \Sigma^* \mid S \stackrel{\ast}{\Rightarrow} w\}$.
