# Context Free Grammar
> [!Info] Definition
> A **context-free grammar** is a 4-tuple $(V,\Sigma, R, S)$, where
> 1. $V$ is a finite set called the **variables**,
> 2. $\Sigma$ is a finite set, disjoint from $V$, called the **terminals**,
> 3. $R$ is a finite set of **rules**, with each rule being a variable and a string of variables and terminals, and
> 4. $S \in V$ is the **start variable**.
