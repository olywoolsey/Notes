The statement is discussing the composition of a language $L$ from a union of several other languages $L_1, L_2, \ldots, L_n$, each of which has a specific property concerning deterministic finite automata (DFA). Let's break down the statement: 
1. **Finite Set of Languages**: 
	- $L_1, L_2, \ldots, L_n$ are a finite set of languages. 
2. **Union of Languages**: 
	- The language $L$ is defined as the union of these languages, i.e., $L = \bigcup_{0<i\leq n} L_i$ 
	- This means $L$ contains all the strings that are in at least one of the languages $L_i$.
3. **Deterministic Finite Automaton with One Accepting State**: 
- For each language $L_i$, there exists a deterministic finite automaton (DFA) that accepts $L_i$ and has exactly one accepting state. 

Putting this all together, the statement means: 
- The language $L$ is the union of several languages $L_1, L_2, \ldots, L_n$.
- Each of these languages $L_i$ can be recognised by a DFA that has exactly one accepting state. 
### Implications and Significance 
- **Union of Languages**: The language $L$ combines all the strings that any of the $L_i$ languages accept.
- **DFA with One Accepting State**: The fact that each $L_i$  can be recognised by a DFA with exactly one accepting state implies a certain simplicity or restriction in the structure of the automata recognising each $L_i$. 

This setup might be used to illustrate properties of regular languages, as any union of regular languages (languages recognised by DFAs) is also a regular language. The additional constraint that each $L_i$ has a DFA with only one accepting state might be useful in proving certain properties or constructing a DFA for $L$.


- **Pairwise Union**: $L = L_1 \cup L_2 \cup L_3$
- **Big Union**: $L = \bigcup_{0 < i \leq 3} L_i$
