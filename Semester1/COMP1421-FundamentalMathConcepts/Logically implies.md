#logic
- Let p and q be formulas
- We say that p logically implies q, if p → q is a tautology
- The notation p |= q denotes that p logically implies q.
- he symbol ⇒ is sometimes used instead of |= to denote logical [[implication]]
---
- The symbol |= is not a logical connective, and p |= q is not a formula but rather is the statement ‘p → q is a tautology’
- the truth table for p => q shows that if p is one then q is always 1 but if p is zero then q can be either
| p   | q   | p -> q |
| --- | --- | ------ |
| 0   | 0   | 1      |
| 0   | 1   | 1      |
| 1   | 0   | 0      |
| 1   | 1   | 1      |
