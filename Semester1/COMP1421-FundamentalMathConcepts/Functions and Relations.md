## Functions
- Domain: the input set
- Co-domain: every possible outcome
- Range: the sets that are outputted from the function
- g o f  =  f(g(x))
F: A $\rightarrow$ B
### Injective
- no two elements will be mapped to the same elements
- can have a bigger co-domain than range
### Surjective
- Range and co-domain are equal
- some elements can map to the same element
### Bijective
- both injective and surjective
- every element of A will map to an element in the co-domain
