## Direct Proof
In a direct proof, the statement is proven ‘directly’, i. e. without any‘detours
###### E.g.
The integer n is even if there exists an integer k such that n = 2k, and nis odd if there exists an integer k such that n = 2k + 1

## Contraposition
In a proof by contraposition, a statement of the form ‘p → q’ is proved by showing ‘¬q → ¬p’. This is correct, because the statements are logically equivalent

## Contradiction
- By Proving there is a fault when the opposite is assumed then you prove that's it's always correct

## Equivalence
-Proving if and only if ($\leftrightarrow$)

## Induction
- If is true for a value (n = 1)
- and is true for the next value assuming was true for the previous one (n = k, n = k+1)
- then is true for all values (n $\in \mathbb{N}$)

## Common Mistakes
- inadmissible argumentation with examples,
- using the same symbol to denote different things,
- using notions that have not been defined exactly, or even have inconsistent definitions,
- inadmissible gaps in the argumentation
- using unproven claims to justify proof steps,
- thinking that you are finished when there is still something to show, circular reasoning, i. e. using the statement that you are about to prove in the proof,
- mistakes in arithmetic and basic algebra
