## Accessibility
- How get-able a place or location is
- Not the same as **mobility** (ability of individuals to move around)
- Important in other fields, eg disability studies: whether they can get into buildings or use tech
## Proximity of place and inequalities
- How near things are to each other
- transport is inherently spatial, and its aim is to reduce the friction of distance
- ##### Travel time budget
	- humans have a generally stable personal travel-time budget
	- around 60-70 mins per day
	- (stopher et al 2017)
	- increase in speed means people will go further and not necessarily travel less
## 15-20 minute cities
- in ancient times most city's were '15 minute city's' since most people were limited to walking pace
- includes quality of life
- helps with climate actions
- city's adopting this approach include Paris
- concept also included as a commitment in Scotland's Program for Government 2020

## Inequality
- Traditionally looked at from a class perspective
- Significant factors are often described as ‘social determinants’ of inequality
- Often more ‘political determinants’ of inequality, people of colour, women, and disabled people
- Difference between equality and equity
- factors how transport is related to inequality
	1. the way people are distributed geographically
	2. the way opportunities are distributed, inc jobs and education
	3. how accessible transport is, in terms of cost, geographic accessibility, time and reliability
## Racist inequalities of access
### America
- prior to 1960's, black citizens in 'southern states,' were deprived of access to justice
- segregation laws restricted black people to different parts of the bus
- Rosa Parks, 42, refused to give up her seat when the white section was full therefore she was arrested
### South Africa
- whole busses reserved for white people
- Informal segregation on trains prior to 1900 was formalised with railway regulations in 1918 by the British colonisers who passed an enabling Act of Parliament in 1916

## Transport Related Social Exclusion(TRSE)
- TfN (2022) find that 3.3 m people in the North of England live in areas where there is a significant risk of TRSE
	- Car-dependency found to be significant factor
	- Car-dependency in the region made worse by decline bus provision
## Transport poverty
- if defined as 10% on motoring then 80% of UK would be in trans poverty
- harder to define than fuel poverty
- car-related economic stress
## Bus Provision
- bus services have been declining for 7 decades
- constant loop as less funding causes less busses causing less passengers causing lower funding
