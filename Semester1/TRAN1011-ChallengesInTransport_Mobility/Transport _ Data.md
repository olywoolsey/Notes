- Helps to make sense of what happened in the past
- Helps to make decisions about the present
- Helps to plan the shape of the future
- Helps us to understand what is going on:
	- To increase our knowledge of how transport systems operate
	- To identify what works well and what less so
	- To provide evidence of inequalities

## Appraising Infrastructure Investment
- Collect data demonstrating existing demand for trips and likely future growth
- Produces models showing change in behaviour with/without planned facilities
#### M6 Toll 
- Fast Alternative Route
- Demand < Predicted (-33%)
- Inefficient use of resources
- Difficult to recover costs
#### Borders Railway Reopening
- Demand > Predicted(+22%)
- Insufficient Capacity

## Future Questions
- Likely number of car licence holders?
- Likely number of road accidents involving older/younger people?
- Total number of people commuting to work?
- Will cycling numbers go up or down?
- [ ] Future expenditure on concessionary bus passes?
