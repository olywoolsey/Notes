- the de facto standard for modelling systems
“The Unified Modeling Language (UML) is a language for specifying, visualizing,constructing, and documenting the artifacts of software systems, as well as forbusiness modeling and other non-software systems. The UML represents acollection of best engineering practices that have proven successful in themodeling of large and complex systems.” - www.omg.org

## Activity Diagrams
- baisically like a flow chart
- l includes synchronisation bars or swim lanes
## Impleametiation Diagrams
includes both component and Deployment

## Component Diagrams
- Component diagrams illustrate the physical structure of the system in terms of its Software
- They show the software components and the dependencies between them
