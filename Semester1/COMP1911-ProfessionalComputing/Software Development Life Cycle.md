### software development life cycle
 - value of software decreases over time, have to kill software if provides negative value
#### Initiation
- start with an idea
- could be to replace old system
#### Feasibilty
- is the app idea going to sell
- will the app be worth the time
- just because the app would work doesnt mean its a good buisness idea
#### Requirement analysis
- what benifits would stakeholders get
- what buisness process will the system change/ create/ support
- will the buisness be improved, and if they will make savings
- who will use the system
#### Design Stage
- work out how to build it
- hardware? perfomance needs?
#### Buid
- actual programming of the product
- reuse other parts of programs
- test all programs 
##### Types of reusable software
- copy and paste isnt maintainable
- open source is good as many people contribute
- system librarys are also useful
#### Implemtation
- 1/3 of systems fail
- results in a live system
- real users provide feedback
- does it deliver the predicted value
#### Maintain
- fix bugs
- add extra fetures
- upgrade to keep up with os systems
- buisnesses require new features
#### Klil
- cost of support is greater than buisness benifit
- new idea 
- old systems often called legacy systems
### Waterfall model

### Iterative model

### Combination of both
- do waterfall faster but many times
- each time its completed you end with a prototype
