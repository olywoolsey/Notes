# IP Addresses
Every public host on the internet has a unique IP address.
Two protocols are currently in use:
- IPv4: Internet Protocol version 4.
- IPv6: Internet Protocol version 6.
IPv6 is gradually replacing IPv4, although there is no road map for the end of IPv4 (yet)
## IPv4
- Usually written as a 4-byte string of 4 integers
- a.b.c.d
- Each byte takes a value from 0 to 255 (i.e. unsigned).
- The ‘4’ in IPv4 does not refer to the number of bytes
- There are only (256)4 ≈ 4.29 × 109 possible addresses, i.e. about 4.3 billion
