# Protocol Stack
- Are defined to pass messages between layers.
- For this reason, sometimes referred to as the protocol stack
- This modular design allows internal components to be easily replaced
- Potential for redundancy â€” overlapping operations carried out at more than one level
- Popular Stacks include [TCP IP](TCP%20IP.md) for the internet and [OSI Model](OSI%20Model.md) for a more general design
