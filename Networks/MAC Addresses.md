# MAC Addresses
Whatever the protocol, each node must have a unique MAC (Media Access Control) address

The MAC (or LAN, physical, Ethernet) address:  
- Used ‘locally’ to get frame from one interface to another.  
- Both interfaces in the same network (in IP sense).  
- 48-bit MAC addresses burned into NIC ROM.  
- e.g. 1A-2F-BB-76-09-AD
