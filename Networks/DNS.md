# Domain Name System
A host can be addressed in either
- A readable host name (i.e. www.leeds.ac.uk)
- An [IP Addresses](IP%20Addresses.md)
	- IPv4 (e.g. 129.168.0.1)
	- IPv6

## Key Concepts:
### Indirection:  
- Names replace IP addresses.  
- We rarely use IP addresses directly.  
### Hierarchy:  
- Apparent in IP addresses, their names, and the DNS server structure itself.  
### Distribution:  
- No single DNS server contains all names or IP addresses.  
- Scalable.  
### Caching:  
- Local caching of DNS results for re-use
