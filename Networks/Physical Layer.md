# Physical Layer
*Responsible for moving individual bits between nodes*
- Different media (e.g. twisted-pair copper, fibre optics) have different characteristics (frequency, signal decay)
- Therefore also have different Ethernet protocols

Wireless communication has high error rates and multiple access
- Also has many different protocols.  
- i.e. IEEE 802.11 (‘WiFi’), IEEE 802.15.1 (‘Bluetooth’), IEEE 802.15.4 (‘Zigbee’; ‘Internet of things’)

The Physical layer is where data is converted to/from e.g.electrical or radio signals
- May involve digital-to-analogue conversion
- Sometimes merged with the Link layer
