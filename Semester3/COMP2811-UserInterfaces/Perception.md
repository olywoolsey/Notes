## Wavelength and Colour
- Photons carry energy with them
- Proportional to “wavelength”
- “Wavelength” is “colour”
Our eyes can most often see:
- wavelengths 350 - 700 nm
- all the colours of the rainbow

We require contrasting colours (will be detailed further in Visual Layout Design lectures)Blind Spots Optical Illusions
## Common range of disability / impairment
- epilepsy
- Visual Impairment
- Colour Blindness
### Epilepsy
#### Triggered by
- Flashing
- Flickering
- Moving Patterns
#### Sensitivity
- Most people sensitive to red flashing
- Daylight and artificial lights
- Most dangerous frequency risk is 5 to 30 Hz
#### Blinking
- Content that causes a distraction problem
- Can be allowed for a short time or can be stopped
#### Flashing
- Content that can trigger a seizure (if it is more than 3Hz,large and bright enough)
- Not permitted, even for a second
#### Harding Test
- Harding test automatically flags PSE issues
- Ofcom’s PSE thresholds have been implemented in software:
	“Harding Flashing and Spatial Patterns”
### Visual Imperment
#### Macular degeneration
- Blurred or no visionin centre of the visualfield
- Often age related• Caused by damage tothe retin
- UK prevalence of 4.8%in those over 65 years
- No cure for age relatedmacular degeneration
#### Colour Blindness
- Inability to see certain colours
- Red/green colourblindness is the most common:weak or missing green cones
- Affects ~8% of Men and ~0.5% of women. 300m people worldwide
- Traffic Light Example
	- UK has large white borders on traffic lights to help identification
	- Newer lights introduced a “bluer”green colour to assist CB issue

## Optical Illusions
lateral inhibition

### Reification
- The brain’s ability to infer whole forms from unrelated components
- Part of the Gestalt theory, and closely related to visual desing patterns – e.g. useful to suggest groupings

Human vision is very sensitive to edges
Caused by boosted response to high spatial frequencies
### Mach Bands
- Achromatic' contrast effect at edges
- Darker region seems to have darker band near border
- Extra light band on lighter region
- Grey rectangles appear non-uniform
- Highlights difference between stimulation and perception
- Important function in design for edge detection
