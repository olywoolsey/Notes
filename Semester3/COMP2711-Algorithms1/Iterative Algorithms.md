## Simple Loops
An iterative algorithm consists of statements repeated a number of times in a loop

[[Big O]] for both is O(n)
for $i\leftarrow 1$ to n do
	application code

i $\leftarrow$ 1
while $i\leftarrow$ n do
	application code 
	$i \leftarrow i + 1$

## Nested Loops
for $i\leftarrow 1$ to n do
	for $j\leftarrow 1$ to n do
		 application code
