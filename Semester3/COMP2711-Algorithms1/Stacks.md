# Stacks
#COMP2711 #DataStructures 
*(Special type of [List](Lists.md))*
Is a data structure which has a top and bottom end; only supports two operations:
- **Push** - add to the top of the stack
- **Pop** - delete from the top end of the stack
*Example: Page visited History in a browser*
## Properties
- Less flexible than [Lists](Lists.md)
- Easy to implement
- Often used to:
	- Reverse data
	- parse data
	- perform backtracking
## Two implementations
| Array-base implementation | Linked Implementation |
| ---- | ---- |
| Limited size ( possible issues with push) | "Unlimited" size |
