# Dynamic Systems Development Method - DSDM
Encapsulates the principles of RAD as a more formal methodology. 
Nine key principles:
1. Active user involvement is imperative
2. Teams must be empowered to make decisions
3. Focus on frequent delivery of products
4. Deliverables MUST be fit for their BUSINESS purpose
5. Iterative (and incremental) development -> convergence on the best solution
6. All changes should be reversible
7. High Level requirements are agreed (and “frozen”) to set the scope
8. Testing is integrated throughout (not just at the end)
9. Collaboration and co-operation with stakeholders throughout
