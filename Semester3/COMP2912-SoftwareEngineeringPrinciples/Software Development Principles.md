Fred Brookes - characteristics of software that makes it different:
- Invisibility; progress in building software can’t be seen
- Complexity; software is more complex than other engineered products
- Conformity; software conforms to human “rules” rather than physical rules like gravity, human rules are subject to change.
- Flexibility; software is flexible, it is subject to a high degree of change throughout it’s life but this change brings further complexity

If we are building software we need to build fast not much, need a MVP
As software is not set in stone you can change it therefore it is easy to change over time
