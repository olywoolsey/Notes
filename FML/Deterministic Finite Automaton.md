# Deterministic finite automaton
- (Finite State Machine)
- a 5-tuple $(Q, Σ, δ, q_0, F)$, where
	- $Q$ is a finite set called the states
	- $\sum$ is a finite set called the alphabet
	- $δ : Q × Σ \rightarrow Q$ is the transition function
	- $q_0 ∈ Q$ is the start state
	- $F ⊆ Q$ is the set of accepting states
