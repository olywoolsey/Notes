#COMP1211 
Computers provide a mechanism by which other modules may interrupt the normal processing sequence
- Some devices can be many orders of magnitude slower than the CPU
- Interrupts allow the CPU to work, pausing to service external devices only when they signal that they require attention
- The processor and operating system are responsible for suspending and resuming the user program appropriately
## Classes
- Program
	e.g. overflow, division by zero
- Timer
	Generated by internal processor timer
- I/O
	An I/O controller signals operation completion
- Hardware failure
	e.g. power failure, memory parity error.
## Program Flow Control

	Program flow control with and without interrupts
- by using interrupts programs can run simultaneously
- main program doesn't have to wait for replies so can run at the same time while external commands and data is collected
## Nested vs sequential Interrupts
- Sequential interrupts wait for the previous interrupt to finish before starting the next interrupt
- Nested interrupts are able to interrupt other interrupts
## Interrupt cycle
- If there’s no interrupt, fetch the next instruction.
- If an interrupt is pending:
	- suspend execution of the current program and save its“state”;
	- set the PC to the start address of the interrupt handler routine and process the interrupt;
	- restore the previous state and continue the interrupted program.
