# Optimising Visualisations
![](Order_Of_Reading.png)
## Memory
- **Iconic memory** is unconscious and is ruled by pre-attentive attributes.Guide your audience to look at certain aspects of your visualisation.
- **Short term memory** can hold about 4 pieces of visual information.Do not overload or make your audience work too hard.
- **Long term memory** is “lifetime” memory.Make the message stick with your audience – story telling using visuals
## Pre-attentive Attributes
- These unconsciously grab your audiences attention and can be used to highlight your key points.
- The main pre-attentive attributes are **Colour**, $_{\text{Size}}$ and $Font$
- When creating a visual close your eyes or look away then note where your eyes are drawn towhen you look back
### Colour
- Be conscious of your use of colour - resist the urge to use colour for the sake of being colourful.
- Be consistent with colours – never change colours just for the sake of novelty.
- Think about the tone you are setting with the colours you choose.
- People associate colours with different brands
- Don't have a multitude of colours, often shades is much better
- Be considerate of colourblindness - Red Green is very common
### Font
- **Bold**
- *Italics*
- <ins>underline</ins>
### Size
We notice things that are larger first.
If you are showing things that are of equal importance keep them at equal size.
If one attribute or message is much more important make it bigger
