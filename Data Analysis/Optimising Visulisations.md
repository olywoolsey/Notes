# Optimising Visualisations
![](Order_Of_Reading.png)
## Memory
- **Iconic memory** is unconscious and is ruled by pre-attentive attributes.Guide your audience to look at certain aspects of your visualisation.
- **Short term memory** can hold about 4 pieces of visual information.Do not overload or make your audience work too hard.
- **Long term memory** is “lifetime” memory.Make the message stick with your audience – story telling using visuals
## Pre-attentive Attributes
- These unconsciously grab your audiences attention and can be used to highlight your key points.
- The main pre-attentive attributes are **Colour**, $_{\text{Size}}$ and $Font$
- When creating a visual close your eyes or look away then note where your eyes are drawn to when you look back

### Colour
- Be conscious of your use of colour - resist the urge to use colour for the sake of being colourful.
- Be consistent with colours – never change colours just for the sake of novelty.
- Think about the tone you are setting with the colours you choose.
- People associate colours with different brands
- Don't have a multitude of colours, often shades is much better
- Be considerate of colourblindness - Red Green is very common
### Font
- **Bold**
- *Italics*
- <ins>underline</ins>
### Size
- We notice things that are larger first.
- If you are showing things that are of equal importance keep them at equal size.
- If one attribute or message is much more important make it bigger

## Gestalts 6 Principles of Visual Perception
!> noun Word forms: plural -stalts or -stalten (-ˈʃtæltən ) (sometimes not capital) aperceptual pattern or structure possessing qualities as a whole that cannot be described merelyas a sum of its parts.” (Collins)
The word Gestalt is used in modern German to mean the way a thing has been “placed,” or“put together.” There is no exact equivalent in English. “Form” and “shape” are the usual translations; in psychology the word is often interpreted as “pattern” or “configuration.””
### Proximity
- We tend to think of objects that are physically close together as belonging to part of a group.
- Used in tables; see there are no lines but still see in groups

### Similarity
- We presume that objects that are visually similar are all part of a group.
### Enclosure
- We think of objects that are physically enclosed together as belonging to part of agroup.
- It can draw a visual distinction within data

### Closure
People like things to be simple and fit into constructs that are already in our mind
### Continuity
- When looking at objects we seek the smoothest path and naturally create continuity even where it may not explicitly exist

### Connection
- We tend to think of objects that a physically connected as part of the same group.
- The connective property has a stronger connection than similar colour, size or shape that we saw in the similarity principle.
- However it is not stronger than enclosure.

## Cognitive Load
- Every time we take in information we experience cognitive load. It can bethought of as mental effort.
- Every single element you add to a page or screen takes up cognitive load(mental effort).
- That means we should take a discerning eye to the elements we allow on our page or screen and work to identify those things that are taking up brainpower unnecessarily and remove them.
- Visual elements that take up space and cognitive load but do not improve understanding can be seen as clutter
