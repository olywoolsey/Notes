# Software Development Pronciples
#COMP2912
Fred Brookes - characteristics of software that makes it different:
- Invisibility; progress in building software can’t be seen
- Complexity; software is more complex than other engineered products
- Conformity; software conforms to human “rules” rather than physical rules like gravity, human rules are subject to change.
- Flexibility; software is flexible, it is subject to a high degree of change throughout it’s life but this change brings further complexity
## Failure
A Project that has been cancelled or does not meet its budget, delivery or business objectives

If we are building software we need to build fast not much, need a MVP
As software is not set in stone you can change it therefore it is easy to change over time

For final year project try to use the Unified Process style

Similar to Test Driven Development and [Software Development Life Cycle](../../Professional%20Computing/Software%20Development%20Life%20Cycle.md)
<marquee>I LOVE AGILE  </marguee>
## Disciplined [Agile](Agile.md) Development
- [DAD](../../Professional%20Computing/DAD.md) is the most recent form of the unified process
- 4 Phases of a Unified Process Project
	1. Inception
	2. Elaboration
	3. Construction
	4. Transition
## [eXtreme Programming](../../Professional%20Computing/eXtreme%20Programming.md)
- New versions built several times a day
- Increments delivered every 2 weeks
- All tests must be run for every build and is only accepted if all tests run correctly

## Scrum
- Comes from rugby
- Sprints are 2-4 weeks
- Has a product backlog which in each sprint you decide which problem needs to be solved
- No more than 7 in a team (8 should be 2 teams of 4)

## Kanban
- For 5 year olds
- Have Backlog, To-do, Doing, Done
- Can work alongside scrum
