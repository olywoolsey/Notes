# eXtreme Programming
A very influential [agile](Agile.md) method, developed in the late 1990s, that introduced a range of agile development technique
- New versions built several times a day
- Increments delivered to customers every 2 weeks
- All tests must be run for every build and the build is only accepted if tests run successfully

| Principle or Practice | Description |
| ---- | ---- |
| Incremental planning | Requirements are recorded on story cards and the stories to be included in a release are determined by the time available and their relative priority. The developers break these stories into development ‘Tasks’. |
| Small releases | The minimal useful set of functionality that provides business value is developed first. Releases of the system are frequent and incrementally add functionality to the first release |
| Simple design | Enough design is carried out to meet the current requirements and no more |
| Test-first development | Test framework is written before before functionality is implemented |
| Refactoring | All developers are expected to refactor the code continuously as soon as possible code improvements are found. This keeps thecode simple and maintainable. |
| Pair programming | Developers work in pairs, checking each other’s work and providing support |
| Collective ownership | Developers work on all all areas of the code and take responsibility for all of it. Anyone can change anything |
| Continuous integration | Once a task is complete is is integrated into the whole system and all system tests must pass |
| Sustainable pace | Large amounts of overtime are not acceptable; reduce code quality and lower productivity |
| On-site customer | A rep from the customer should always be available. They are responsible for bringing the system requirements to the team |
