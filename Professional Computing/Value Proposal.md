Has a neutral effect, UNLESS is slower than the user's cognitive process. if so it increases effort.
Performance is an emergent property of all computing elements in a system – all of the hardware, networks and software used to support the use case.
Two main issues: 
- Latency – the time lag between user action and computer response
- Reliability – not crashing, free from error, consistent
